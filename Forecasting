Homework – Forecasting 

2.7: 
The aus_arrivals data set comprises quarterly international arrivals to Australia from Japan, New Zealand, UK and the US. 
o Use autoplot(), gg_season() and gg_subseries() to compare the differences between the arrivals from these four countries. 
o Can you identify any unusual observations?

5.9: 
Create a training set for household wealth (hh_budget) by withholding the last four years as a test set. 
Fit all the appropriate benchmark methods to the training set and forecast the periods covered by the test set. 
Compute the accuracy of your forecasts. Which method does best? 
Do the residuals from the best method resemble white noise?

view(hh_budget) frequency(hh_budget) train <- hh_budget%>% filter(Year < 2013) 
fit <- train %>% model( Mean=MEAN(Wealth)) 
fc <- fit %>% forecast(h=4) fc %>% autoplot(hh_budget, level=NULL)

3.10: 
This exercise uses the canadian_gas data (monthly Canadian gas production in billions of cubic metres, January 1960 – February 2005). 
a. Plot the data using autoplot(), gg_subseries() and gg_season() to look at the effect of the changing seasonality over time.1 
b. Do an STL decomposition of the data. You will need to choose a seasonal window to allow for the changing shape of the seasonal component. 
c. How does the seasonal shape change over time? [Hint: Try plotting the seasonal component using gg_season().] 
d. Can you produce a plausible seasonally adjusted series? 
e. Compare the results with those obtained using SEATS and X-11. How are they different?

#e.2 and allows you to access the components 
x11_dcmp %>% ggplot(aes(x = Month)) + geom_line(aes(y = Volume, colour = "Data")) + geom_line(aes(y = season_adjust,

#e.3 SEATS decomposition can be used with quarterly and monthly data 
seats_dcmp <- canadian_gas %>% 
model(seats = feasts:::SEATS(Volume)) %>% 
components() 
autoplot(seats_dcmp) + xlab("Year") + ggtitle("SEATS decomposition of total Canadian Usage")
